# 👋🏽 I'm Lionel

> i write my code like i write my poetry:  
> listening to silence and naming what moves beneath.

self-taught, self-shaped, system-bound and story-driven.  
currently completing a professional course in **Network & Systems Management**, and preparing to enter university in **Data Science & AI**.  
linux is my sanctuary, python is my brush, and curiosity is my only constant.
