## who i am

a self-taught, self-shaped developer whose journey is as much about art as it is about code.  
currently, i'm immersed in a **Network & Systems Management** course and gearing up for a future in **Data Science & AI**.  
linux is my sanctuary, and python is the instrument with which i paint my ideas.
